# Vagrant Components

## Vagrantfile

The Vagrantfile is a configuration file that defines how Vagrant sets up and manages VM environments

* Specifies the base operating system image to be used for the VM
* Defines settings for the virtualization providers (Ex: *Allocated memory*, *CPU*, *Network configurations*, *etc.*)
* Sets up network options (Ex: *Forwarded ports*, *Private network settings*, *Public network settings*, *etc.*)
* Enables files to be share by configuring shared folders between the host and the gues machine
* Automates the installation and configuration of software on the VM using automation tools
