The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol is a networking protocol developed by Microsoft that's used to create VPN tunnels between two devices over a public network

* Uses the GRE protocol to encapsulate frames within a VPN client's IP packets in order to transmit data packets over the internet
* Uses the Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption encryption algorithm the encrypt the data payload of each packet in order to secure the data transmitted over the VPN tunnel
* Supports various authentication methods (Ex: *MS-CHAP*, *EAP*, *etc.*)
