# Site Reliability Engineering Overview

SRE is a discipline that applies software engineering principles to operations to achieve high reliability, scalability, and efficiency

# Site Reliability Engineering Principles

## Embrace Risk with Error Budgets

* 100% reliability is neither realistic nor cost-effective
* Define SLOs and allocate an error budget to balance stability and innovation (If error budget is exceeded, focus on improving reliability instead of deploying new features)

## Reduce Toil Through Automation

## Monitoring, Observability, and Incident Response

* Implement proactive monitoring using publicly available tools (*Prometheus*, *Grafana*, *Datadog*, *Zabbix*, *etc.*)
* Ensure observability by collecting logs, metrics, and traces
* Set up automated alerting to detect issues before users are impacted using publicly available tools (*PagerDuty*, *Opsgenie*, *etc.*)
* Conduct blameless postmortems to learn from incidents without punishing individuals

## Release Engineering and CI/CD

* Use progressive rollouts to minimize impact (*Canary deployments*, *Blue-green deployments*, *etc.*)
* Implement new feature flags to enable and disable new features without redeploying code
* Ensure rollback strategies are in place for failed deployments

## Capacity Planning and Demand Forecasting

* Continuously analyze system usage trends and anticipate scaling needs
* Use autoscaling mechanisms to handle traffic spikes dynamically
* Conduct load testing and chaos engineering to prepare for failures

## Blameless Culture and Continuous Learning

* Encourage a blameless incident response to focus on what happened rather than who's at fault
* Document and share learnings from incidents through postmortems
* Foster a culture of experimentation and continuous improvement
