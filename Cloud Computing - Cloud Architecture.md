| Cloud Computing Architecture Layer Category | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| **Frontend** | The client side of a cloud computing system |
| **Internet** | The medium that allows the relation and communication between a cloud computing system's frontend and backend |
| **Backend** | The cloud computing system used and provided by the service provider |

## Frontend

| Cloud Computing Frontend Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Client Infrastructure** | The applications that users interact with to access cloud services |

## Backend

| Cloud Computing Backend Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Application** | Responsible for handling the execution of applications from users within the client infrastructure (Ex: *Business logic*, *Data processing*, *etc.*) |
| **Service** | Responsible for delivering cloud service to end-users within the client infrastructure (Ex: ***IaaS***, ***PaaS***, ***SaaS***) |
| **Cloud Runtime** | Provides the execution and runtime environment to a VM |
| **Storage** | Provides accessible, durable, and scalable storage solutions to support applications and services |
| **Infrastructure** | The hardware and software components of a cloud infrastructure (Ex: *Servers*, *Storage network devices*, *Virtualization software*, *etc.*) |
| **Management** | The management of backend components |
| **Security** | The implementation of different security mechanisms in the backend for secure cloud resources |
