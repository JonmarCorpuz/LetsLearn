* Bypasses the internet to offer more consistent network performance, higher bandwidth, and potentially lower data transfer costs by staying on the AWS global network, which also reduces the chance of hitting bottlenecks or unexpected increases in latency
* Enables users to establish a reliable and secure connection to AWS for the transfer of large amounts of data, real-time data feeds, or mission-critical applications that demand stable network performance
