Containers are software packages that contain an application and all dependencies for the contained application to run

* Containers run on a Containter Engine (Ex: *Docker Engine*, *etc.*), which is run on a host OS (Ex: *Linux*, *etc.*)
* Lightweight and includes only the dependencies that are required for the application to run
* Very portable (Ex: *Can boot up in milliseconds*, *Take up very little disk space*, *Can be run on nearly any container service*, *Uses much fewer CPU/RAM resources*, *etc.*)
* Doesn't require a Guest OS to run
* Provides isolation since they're all in their own independent container (If the Host OS crashes, all containers running on it are effected)
