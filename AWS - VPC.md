An Amazon Virtual Private Cloud allows users to create and manage isolated virtual networks within the AWS cloud environment

* Enables users to define and control a virtual network environment that closely resembles a traditional network 
* Enables users to create multiple isolated virtual networks (VPCs) within their AWS account, where each VPC operates as a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud and allows users to define its own IP address range, subnets, route tables, and network access control policies
* Allows users to define custom routing tables to control the flow of traffic within their virtual network
* Provides users several options for connecting their virtual network to the internet (Ex: *Internet Gateways*, *NAT gateways*, *Virtual Private Gateways*, *etc.*), allowing them to control inbound and outbound internet traffic to and from your VPC resources
* Offers robust security features to help users secure their virtual environment (Ex: *Security groups to control traffic to their instances*, *VPN connections to encrypt data in transit between their VPC and on-premises networks*, *etc.*)
* Seamlessly integrates with other AWS services, allowing users to deploy and manage a wide range of cloud resources within their virtual environment
