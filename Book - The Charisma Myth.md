# Introduction

> "An extensive research in recent years has shown, charisma is the result of specific nonverbal behaviors, not an inherent or magical personal quality. This is one of the reasons why charisma levels fluctuate: its presense depends on whether or not someone is exhibiting these bahvrios." (p.4)

# Chapter 1: Charisma Demystified

> "Three quick tips to gain an instant charisma boost in conversation: **Lower the intonation of your voice at the end of your sentences**. **Reduce how quickly and how often you nod**. **Pause for two full seconds before you speak**." (p.10)

# Chapter 2: The Charismatic Behaviors

> "Charismatic behavior can be broken down into three core elements: **presence**, **power**, and **warmth**" (p.13)

> "When we're not fully present in an interactions, people will see it. Our body language sends a clear message that other people read and react to, at least on the subconscious level." (p.14)

> "When you're fully present, it shows in your body language in a highly charisma-enhancing way. Being charismatic does not depend on how much time you have but on how fully present you are in each interaction. The ability to be fully present makes you stand out from the crowd; it makes you memorable." (p.17)

> "Increaing your ability to be present not only improves your body langauge, listening skills, and mental focus, it could even enhance your ability to enjoy life" (p.17)

> "Being seen as powerful means being perceived as able to affect the world around us, whether through influence on or authority over others, large amounts of money, expertise, intelligence, sheer physical strength, or high social status. We look for clues of power in someone's appearance, in others' reaction to this person, and, most of all, in the person's body language." (p.18)

> "Being seen as warm means being perceived as any of the following: benevolent, altruistic, caring, or willing to impact our world in a positive way. Warmth is assessed almost entirely through body language and behavior; it's evaluated more directly than power. (p.18)

> "Throughout our interactions, we instinctively look for clues with which to evaluate warmth or power, and then we adjust our assumptions accordingly. Expensive clothing leads us to assume wealth, friendly body language leads us to assume good intentions, a confident posture leads us to assume the person has something to be confident about. In essence, people will tend to accept whatever your project. Just by increasing your projection of power or your projection of warmth, you increase your level of charisma. But when you can project both power and warmth together, you really maximize your personal charisma potential." (p.19)

> "Someone who is powerful but not warm can be impressive, but isn't necessarily perceived as charismatic and can come across as arrogant, cold, or standoffish. Someone who possesses warmth without prower can be likable, but isn't necessarily perceived as charismatic and can come across as overeager, subservient, or desperate to please." (p.20)

> "For charisma, your body language matters far more than your words do. No matter how powerful your message or how skillfully crafter your pitch, if your body language is wrong, you won't be charismatic. On the other hand, with the right body langauge you can be charismatic without saying a word. Projecting presence, power, and warmth through your body language is often all you need to be perceived as charismatic." (p.21)

> "Our facial expressions, voice, posture, and all the other components of body language reflect our mental and emotional condition every second. Because we don't control this flow consciously, whatever is in our head will show up in our body language. Even if we control the main expression on our face or the way we hold our arms, legs, or head, if our internal state is different from what we're aiming to portray, sooner or later what's called microexpression will flash across our face. These split-second microexpressions may be fleeting, but they will be caught by observers. And if there's an incongruence between our main expression and that microexpression, people will feel it on a subconscious level: their gut will tell them something's not quite right." (p.21-22)

> "Striving to acquire external charisma skills without learning how to handle your internal world is like adding pretty balconies to a house with a weak foundation. It's a nice touch, but at the first earthquake everything falls apart." (p.23)

> "Individuals with strong internal skills are aware of what exactly is happening inside them and know how to handle it. They can recognize when their self-confidence has taken a hit and have the tools to get back to a confident state so that their body language remains charismatic." (p.23)

> "The internal skills necessary for charisma include both the awareness of your internal state and the tools to effectively manage it." (p.24)

> "Because your brain cannot distinguish imagination from reality, imaginary situations cause your brain to send your body the same commands as it would for a real situation. Whatever your mind believes, your body will manifest." (p.24-25)

> "Due to the fact that whatever is in our mind affects our body, and because our mind has trouble distinguishing imagination from reality, whatever we imagine can have an impact on our body language and, thus, on our levels of charisma. Our imagination can dramatically enhance or inhibit our charisma, depending on its content." (p.26)

Key Takeaways:

* Charisma has three essential components: presence, power, and warmth
* Being present and paying attention to what's going on rather than being caught up in your throughts can yield immense rewards
* When you exhibit presence, those around you feel listened to, respected, and valued
* Because your mind can't tell the difference between imagination and reality, by creating a charismatic internal state your body language will authentically display charisma
* Get the internal state right, and the right charismatic behaviors and body language will pour forth automatically
