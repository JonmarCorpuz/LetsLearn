# Burp Suite Repeater Overview

Burp Suite's repeater automates attacks by automatically sending programmatically modified requests

* Meant for manunal, detailed modifications of a single request
* Good for exploiting bugs manually, trying to bypass filters, and testing out different attack methods that target the same endpoint
