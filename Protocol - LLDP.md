The Link Layer Discovery Protocol (IEEE 802.1AB) is a vendor-neutral Layer 2 protocol that's used to advertise and discover information about networking devices that are directly connected to each other

* Allows devices to announce their identity, capabilities, and information about their neighbors on the network (Ex: *Device type*, *Device name*, *Port Identifier*, *VLAN information*, *System capabilities*, *etc.*)
* Considered as a security risk since they share information about the devices in the network
