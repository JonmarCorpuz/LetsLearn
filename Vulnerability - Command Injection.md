Command Injection is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an application allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host OS

* Happens when user input is improperly handled and concatenated with system commands in such a way that the input can modify or extend the execution of the command

# Types of Command Injection

## Blind Command Injection

Blind Command Injection is where there's no direct output from the application when testing payloads

## Verbose Command Injection

Verbose Command Injection is where there's direct feedback from the application once you have tested a payload
