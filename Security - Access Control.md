Access control is a security measure that regulates and restricts access to a system or physical facility (Ex: *Firewall*, *NAC*, *IAM*, *Load Balancing*, *Network Segmentation*, *VPN*, *Zero Trust*, *etc.*)

# Types of Access Control

## Discretionary Access Control

DAC states that the resource owner will explicitly assign different users with specific access levels and permissions to their resource

* Can be implemented using Access Control Lists, which are a set of rules or configurations associated with a resource that dictate who's allowed to access that resource and what operations they're allowed to perform

## Role-Based Access Control

RBAC states that entities are authorized to access resources based on their roles

## Mandatory Access Control

MAC manages access to resources based on predefined security policies

* Based on a strict need-to-known basis 
* Access to information must be granted manually by a central authority or system administrator
