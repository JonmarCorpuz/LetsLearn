# Project Types

## Freestyle Project

* Limited to only defining steps in a simple sequence
* Configuration is done entirely through the GUI
* Not ideal for complex workflows
* Cannot be resumed after a Jenkins Controller failure
* A legacy approach since they lack the flexibility and maintainability needed for most modern continuous delivery or deployment pipelines
* You can chain multiple Freestyle projects together
