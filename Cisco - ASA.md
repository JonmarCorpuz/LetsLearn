Cisco's Adaptive Security Appliance is a security device that provides various security services for networks of various sizes 

* Can act as a stateful firewall in order to enfore security policies to control the flow of traffic between different network segments
* Supports VPN technologies in order to allow secure communication over public networks (Ex: *Sire-to-site VPN*, *Remote access VPN*, *etc.*)
* Includes IPS capabilities to detect and prevent network-based attacks in real-time by inspecting traffic for known threats and anomalous behavior and taking action to block or mitigate potential attacks
* Can offer Advanced Malware Protection technology
* Provides application layer visibility and control, allowing administrators to enforce policies based on specific applications and protocols
* Can integrate with IAM systems for user authentication and authorization, allowing administrators to create access control policies based on user identities (Ex: *User base authentication*, *etc.*)
* Generates logs and reports that provide visibility into network traffic, security events, and device performance
