## First Hop Redundancy Protocols

A FHRP is a computer networking protocol that's designed to protect the default gateway used on a network by allowing two or more routers to provide backup for that address 

* In the event of a failure of an active router, the backup router will take over the address
* FHRP enabled routers will share a Virtual Router IP, which is a virtual IP address that the end devices on the network will use as their default gateway
