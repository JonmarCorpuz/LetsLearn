Subnetting is a technique used to divide a single network into smaller and more manageable sub-networks in order to reduce network congestion and improve network performance

* Involves splitting an IP address space into multiple smaller subnets that are each identified by its own unique subnet mask
* Allows for better organization of network resources (Ex: *More efficient use of IP addresses*, *etc.*)
* Allows for better security (Ex: *Isolating parts of the network*, *etc.*)
* Each subnet is identified by a unique subnet mask, which determines the range of IP addresses that belong to that subnet

# Subnetting Methods

## FLSM

Fixed Length Subnet Masking is a subnetting technique that's used to divide a network into subnets of equal size, each containing the same subnet mask

* Can lead to inefficient allocation of IP addresses

## VLSM

Variable Length Subnet Masking is a subnetting technique used to allocate IP addresses for efficiently 

* Allows for subnets of different sizes within the same network by using subnet masks of varying lengths
