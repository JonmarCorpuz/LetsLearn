A Virtual Private Network is a technology that creates a private and secure communication channel a user's end device and a remote server or network

* Increases privacy by concealing personal information (Ex: *IP addresses*, *etc.*)
* Provides a server that acts as a gateway between a computer and the Internet, which creates a path similar to a virtual tunnel that hides the computer's IP address and encrypts the data in transit to the Internet
* Enables trusted and encrypted connections to be established on non-trusted networks
* The secure tunnel varies per protocol
* Uses a process called encapsulation, which wraps a user's encrypted data in an unencrypted data packet enabling their data to be sent across a public network while remaining anonymous

# Types of VPNs

## Remote Access

A remote access VPN is a VPN that enables users to connect to a private network securely from a remote location through the Internet

* Usually used to establish a connection between a personal device and a VPN server
* Encrypts data sent and received through a personal device

## Site-to-Site 

A site-to-site VPN is a VPN that connects entire different LANs together, creating a virtual network-to-network connection

* Creates a secure communication channel between LANs of different locations, allowing them to function as a single, unified network
* Used to extend a network to other networks and locations 
* Useful for enterprises that have offices across the globe
* IPSec is commonly used to create an encrypted tunnel between the primary network and the remote network
* Can be complex to configure and manage compared to remote access VPNs
