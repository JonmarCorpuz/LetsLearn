An Application Programming Interface is a middleware that facilitates the communication of two software components by using a set of protocols and definitions

* "Application" refers to any software having specific functionality and "Interface" refers to the service contract between two applications that make communication possible via requests and responses
* Allows applications to interact with web services to retrieve or send data
* Enables different software systems from different vendors to communicate and exchange data
* Automates routine tasks (Ex: *Updating databases*, *Generating reports*, *Managing cloud resources*, *etc.*)
* Enables developers to embed third-party services into their applications
* Facilitates real-time communication between application
* Used to implement security features (Ex: *Authentication*, *Data encryption*, *Rate limiting*, *Access control*, *etc.*)
