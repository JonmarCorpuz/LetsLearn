# Data Types

| Data Type | Description |

| Char | |
| String | |
| Int | |
| Float | |
| Double | |
| Boolean | |

**Integers**
* Always take up 4 bytes (32 bits) of memory, meaning that the range of values they can store is necessarily limited to 32 bits worth of information
* Integer values range between -2 147 483 648 (-2^31) and 2 147 483 647 (2^31 - 1)
* Unsigned integers allows a more larger range of positive values at the cost of disallowing any negative values, which increases the maximum value to 4 294 967 295 (2^32 - 1)

**Characters**
* Always take up 1 byte (8 bits) of memory, meaning that the range of values that they can store is limited to 8 bits worth of information
* Character values range between -128 and 127

**Floating Point Numbers**
* Always take up 4 bytes (32 bits) in memory, which only allows a precision of 32 bits after the decimal point

**Double**
* Always take up 8 bytes (64 bits) of memory
* Doubles the precision after the decimal point, allowing us to specify much more precise real numbers

**Boolean**
* Always take up 1 bye (8 bits)

**String**
* Each character in a string takes 1 byte (8 bits)

**Unsigned**

# Libraries

Libraries are a collection of pre-written code that provides a set of functions, classes, or routines to perform common tasks

* Helps programmers avoid reinventing the wheel by offering ready-to-use functionalities
