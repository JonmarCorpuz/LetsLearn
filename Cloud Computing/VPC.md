# VPC Overview

A Virtual Private Cloud is a private cloud hosted within a public cloud

* Enables organizations to use the public cloud's resources while being completely isolated from other cloud users
* Forms the backbone of a cloud network
* A global resource (Meaning that they're not attached to any specific zone or region)

# Network Segmentation

An architectural approach that divides a network into subnets

* Improves an organization's ability to closely control and monitor network traffic
* Separating resources that shouldn't communicate with each other into different subnets reduces the attack surface
