An SLO is a target value for a service level that is measured by an SLI

* SLOs can be represented as follows: `SLI <= upper_bound` or `SLI >= lower_bound`
* SLOs are measurable goals for performance over a period of time (Ex: *Latency can exceed 300ms in only 5% of the requests over a rolling 30-day period*)
