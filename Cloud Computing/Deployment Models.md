| **Private Cloud** | A cloud computing system that's dedicated to a single consumer |
| **Public Cloud** | A cloud computing system that's used and shared among multiple consumers |
| **Hybrid Cloud** | A cloud service that combines public cloud computing and private cloud computing systems for different resources |
| **Community Cloud** | A cloud computing system that's shared among organizations with common interests, requirements, or compliance needs |
| **Multi-Cloud** | A cloud computing system that uses multiple cloud service providers to avoid vendor lock-in and leverage best-of-breed services |

# Private Cloud

The Private Cloud deployment model is a cloud computing system that's dedicated to a single consumer

* Considered as a single-tenant environment since the resources are dedicated to a single user
* The organization is responsible over the resources and the infrastructure
* Useful for companies with compliance or regulatory considerations
