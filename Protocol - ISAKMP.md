The Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol is a protocol used 

* Defines procedures and packet formats to establish, negotiate, modify and delete SAs, which contain all the information required for execution of various network security services
* Defines payloads for exchanging key generation and authentication data
* ISAKMP formats provide a consistent framework for transferring key and authentication data independent of the key generation technique, encryption algorithm, and authentication mechanism
