The Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol is a protocol used to establish, neogtiate, modify, and delete SAs and manage keys for IPsec VPNs

* Operates at the Network layer of the OSI model (Layer 3)
* Used to negotiate and manage SAs between VPN peers
* Handles the exchange of keying material used to encrypt and authenticate IPsec traffic
* Negotiates the shared secret keys or digital certificates used by IPsec to secure communication between VPN peers
* Supports various authentication methods (Ex: *Pre-shared keys*, *Digital certificates*, *RSA signatures*, *etc.*)
* Negotiates encryption and hashing algorithms to secure the ISAKMP and IPsec communication channels
* Manages the lifetimes of SAs, as well as the negotiation of key lifetimes and automatic rekeying of SAs to ensure continued security and prevent security vulnerabilities
