# Build Context Overview

A build context refers to the set of files and directories that are sent to the Docker daemon when building a Docker image using the `docker build` command

* Typically includes your Dockerfile and all the files and directories that are referenced in the Dockerfile (*Application source code*, *Configuration files*, *etc.*)
* When you run `docker build`, the Docker client bundles up everything in the specified directory and sends it to the Docker daemon, which will be used to build the Docker image according to the instructions in the Dockerfile (The build context directory is usually the same directory as the Dockerfile, unless specified otherwise)
* Keep the build context as minimal as possible because everything in the build context is sent to the Docker daemon (Unnecessary files can lead to large builds and slower build times if the context includes large files or directories that aren't needed)

# build Folder

The build folder contains the files that were generated by the build command

# Dockerfile 

The [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#:~:text=A%20Dockerfile%20is%20a%20text,line%20to%20assemble%20an%20image.) is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image

* Allows you to define all the steps necessary to build your Docker images
* Reduces the risk of human error by automating the build process for your applications
* Provides a clear overview and full control of all the steps involved in building it

# .dockerignore

The [.dockerignore](https://docs.docker.com/build/concepts/context/#dockerignore-files) files allows you define files or directories to exclude from the build context

* Helps avoid sending unwanted files and directories to the builder
* Improves build speed, especially when using a remote builder
* When you run a build command, the build client looks for a file named `.dockerignore` in the root directory of the context and if this file exists, the files and directories that match patterns in the files are removed from the build context before it's sent to the builder

# Multistage Dockerfiles

A [multi-stage build](https://dev.to/pavanbelagatti/what-are-multi-stage-docker-builds-1mi9#:~:text=A%20multi%2Dstage%20build%20is,on%20both%20time%20and%20space.) build is a process that allows you to break the steps in building a Docker image into multiple stages

* Enables you to create images that include only the dependencies that are necessary for the desired functionality of the final application, cutting down on both time and space

## Stage 1

In the first stage, you'll first build the image that contains only the dependencies needed to build your application

## Stage 2

In this last stage, you can add in any additional layers needed to create your application and configure it for deployment
