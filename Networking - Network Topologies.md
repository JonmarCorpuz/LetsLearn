# Network Topology Types

## Ring Topology

## Star Topology

* Several devices all connect to one central device 

## Bus Topology

## Mesh Topology

A mesh topology is a network topology where each device is connected to multiple other devices

### Partial Mesh Topology

* Some devices are connected to each other, but not all

### Full Mesh Topology

* Each device is connected to each other device

## Tree Topology

## Hub and Spoke

* Usually connected over leased lines
* Easier to centrally control what traffic is allowed and what isn't (Ex: *All spoke traffic can be sent to a firewall within the hub to control which traffic is allowed and which isn't*, *etc.*)
