# PA Firewall Interface Types

## Management Interfaces

* Management Profiles should only have access to this interface

## Network Interfaces

## VLAN Interfaces

## Layer 2 Interfaces

## Layer 3 Interfaces

* Every layer 3 interface must be assigned to a virtual router so that it can forward traffic to other interfaces

## Tap Interfaces

## Loopback Interfaces

## Tunnel Interfaces

* Can be assigned as a layer 2 or layer 3 interface 

## V-Wire Interface

* Logically connects two physical interfaces
* No routing happens on v-wire interfaces
* Allocated to a physical interface
* Allows the firewall to work and enforce security rules in transparent mode, which makes it so that a user or network doesn't know that they're passing through a stateful firewall
