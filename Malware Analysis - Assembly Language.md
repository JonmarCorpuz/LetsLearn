Assembly language is a low-level programming language, which is a type of programming language that provides little to no abstraction from a device's hardware architecture, that serves as a bridge between machine code and higher-level programming languages, which are designed to provide more abstraction from the hardware and lower-level languages in order to make them more portable, easier to understand, and faster to develop

* Specific to a particular device architecture or processor
* Assembly Language instructions correspond to the machine code instructions (Binary instructions) executed by the CPU
* Used for hardware manipulation, portability, addressing critical performance issues, etc.
