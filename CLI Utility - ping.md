Ping is a CLI tool that's used to test the reachability of a host on an IP network

* Allows to determine whether a specific IP address or hostname is reachable
* Measures the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating host to a destination computer
* Can identify if any packets are lost during transmission
* Displays the TTL value, which can help identify routing loops or excessively long paths
* Uses ICMP type 8 (ICMP Echo) and ICMP type 0 (ICMP Reply) messages
