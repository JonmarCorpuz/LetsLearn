Session Initiation Protocol is a signalling protocol that's used for initiating, maintaining, and terminating real-time communication sessions 

* A key component of VoIP
* Used to establish sessions between two or more parties (Ex: *Voice calls*, *Video calls*, *Multimedia conferences*, *Instant messaging*, *etc.*) 
* Operates at the Application layer 
* Uses text-based messages to facilitate communication between endpoints, which are typically exchanged over UDP or TCP connections
* Follows a client-server model, where SIP clients (User agents) initiate communication sessions by sending SIP requests to SIP servers, which include components that handle various aspects of call routing and session management (Ex: *Proxy servers*, *Registrar servers*, *Redirect servers*, *etc.*)
* Uses URIs to address endpoints
* Allows endpoints to negotiate session parameters and exchange session descriptions using Session Description Protocol (SDP), which is used to specify session details that are necessary for establishing communication (Ex: *Media types*, *Codecs*, *IP address*, *etc.*) 
* Designed to be extensible and interoperable with other protocol systems  (Ex: *PSTN*, *RTP*, *etc.*)
