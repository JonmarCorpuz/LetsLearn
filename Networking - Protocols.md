A protocol is a set of rules that governs how devices connect and communicate with each other across a network by defining the procedures and formats that network devices have to follow to perform various tasks

* Specifies how data is formatted and encoded for transmission (Ex: *Header*, *Payloads*, *Footers*, *etc.*)
* Ensures reliable data transmission by determining how errors are detected, reported, and corrected
* Includes methods for addressing individual devices and routing data packets between source and destination across complex networks
* Defines how devices establish and terminate a communication session
* Governs how network devices and connections are controlled and managed
