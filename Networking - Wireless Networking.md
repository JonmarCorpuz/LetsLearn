Wireless networking refers to the technology that allows devices to connect and communicate with each other without the need for physical cables or wires

* Uses radio waves or other wireless signals to transmit data between devices
* All devices within range receive all frames (Just like devices connected to an Ethernet hub), which can lead to data privacy concerns and collisions when devices communicate on the same channel at the same time, making privacy of data within the LAN a greater concern
* It's important to encrypt the data within the LAN or else anyone with a device in range of the transmitter can access that data
* Uses Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) to facilitate half-duplex communications (A device will wait a random period of time for other devices to stop transmitting before it transmits data itself)
* Wireless communications are regulated by various international and national bodies

# Wireless Networking Components

## Wireless Access Points

A wireless AP is a device that connects to a wired network and provides wireless connectivity to devices in its range

## Wireless Routers

A wireless router is a device that combines the functions of a router and an AP

## Wireless Network Interface Cards

A wireless NIC is a hardware that's installed in devices to enable wireless communication

## Wireless Controllers

A wireless controller is a device or software application that manages and controls multiple wireless APs in a centralized manner

* Allows administrators to centrally configure and manage settings for all connected APs (Ex: *SSIDs*, *Security policies*, *Radio frequencies*, *etc.*)
* Facilitates the distribution and installation of firmware updates to all APs from a single interface to ensure uniformity and security compliance

| Wireless Signals Issue | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Signal Absorption | When a wireless signal passes through a material and is converted into heat, weakening the original signal |
| Signal Reflection | When a signal bounces off of a material |
| Signal Refraction | When a wave is bent when entering a medium where the signal travels at a different speed |
| Signal Diffraction |  |
| Signal Scattering |  |
