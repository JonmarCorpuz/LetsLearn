* PoE allows Power Sourcing Equipment (Ex: *Switch*, *etc.*) to provide Powered Devices (Ex: *IP phones*, *IP cameras*, *WAPs*, *etc.*) over an Ethernet cable

# PoE Components

## PSE

* Receives AC power from the outlet and then converts it to DC power to power the PDs
* Sends low power signals, monitors the response, and then determines how much power the PD needs
* Power policing can be configured to prevent a PD from taking too much power (Too much electrical current can damage electrical devices)
