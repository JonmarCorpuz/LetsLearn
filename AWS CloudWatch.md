AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that's provided by AWS

* Collects and stores metrics (Ex: *CPU utilization*, *Network traffic*, *Disk usage*, *etc.*) from various AWS services (Ex: *Amazon EC2*, *Amazon S3*, *Amazon RDS*, *etc.*)
* Allows users to collect, monitor, and store log files generated by AWS resources and applications in real-time (CloudWatch Logs)
* Allows users to create customizable dashboards to visualize metrics and logs data from different AWS resources and applications
* Enables users to set thresholds on metrics and trigger notifications or automated actions when those thresholds are breached
* Provides a stream of system events (Ex: *Instance state changes*, *API calls*, *Schedule events*, *etc.*) that occur within AWS resources (CloudWatch Events)
* Allows users to monitor the availability and performance of their application by simulating user interactions with web applications (CloudWatch Synthetics)
* Uses machine learning algorithms to analyse metric data and automatically detect unusual patterns or anomalies (CloudWatch Anomaly Detection)
