AWS Simple Storage Service is a scalable object storage service provided by AWS

* Allows businesses and developers to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web
* Designed to provide high durability for stored objects by replicating data across multiple geographically dispersed data centers, ensuring that the data remains available in the event of a failure or disaster
* Can scale to accommodate virtually unlimited amounts of data
* Offers high availability, with service-level agreements guaranteeing uptime of 99.99% or higher, ensuring that the data is accessible whenever needed
* Provides multiple layers of security to protect stored data (Ex: *Encryption at rest and in transit*, *ACLs*, *Bucket policies*, *etc.*)
* Offers different storage classes to optimize costs and performance based on data access patterns and retention requirements (Ex: *Standard S3*, *Standard Infrequent Access S3*, *Intelligent-Tiering S3*, *Glacier S3*, *Glacier Deep Archive S3*, *etc.*)
* Allows users to define lifecycle policies to automatically transition objects between different storage classes or delete them after a specified period
* Supports versioning, allowing users to keep multiple versions of an object in the same bucket, which helps protect against accidental deletions or overwrites and enables users to restore previous versions of objects if needed
* Can host static websites directly from a bucket, making it easy to serve static content
* Integrates seamlessly with other AWS services (Ex: *AWS Lambda*, *Amazon CloudFront*, *Amazon RDS*, *Amazon EMR*, *etc.*), enabling users to build scalable and cost-effective solutions for various use cases
