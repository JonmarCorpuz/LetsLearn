A cable refers to the physical medium used to transmit data between devices in a network

* Serves as the infrastructure that connects devices to each other and other networks, allowing them to communicate with each other

## Twisted Pair

A twisted pair cable consists of pairs of insulated copper wires twisted together that transmits data using electrical signals

* The twisting of the wires helps to reduce eletromagnetic interference from external sources and crosstalk between adjacent pairs, improving the cable's performance and reliability

### Unshielded Twisted Pair

* More flexible and cost effective since they don't have additional shielding around the twisted pairs
* Commonly used for Ethernet connections in LANs
* Supports various data rates (Ex: *10 Mbps*, *100 Mbps*, *1000 Mbps*, *etc.*) and standards (Ex: *Fast Ethernet*, *GigabitEthernet*, *etc.*) 

### Shielded Twisted Pair

* Helps further reduce electromagnetic interference and provides better protection against external noise since it has additional shielding around the twisted pairs that are typically made out of metal foil or braided wire
* Commonly used in environments with high levels of electromagnetic interference (Ex: *Industrial areas with a lot of electrical equipment*, *etc.*)
* Less susceptible to electromagnetic interference and crosstalk compared to UTP cables but are generally more expensive and less flexible

## Fiber Optic

A fiber optic cable is a type of cable that transmits data as pulses of light signals over long distances

* Consists of one or more thin strands of glass or plastic fibers surrounded by a protective outer layer
