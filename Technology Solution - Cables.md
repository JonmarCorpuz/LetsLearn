A cable refers to the physical medium used to transmit data between devices in a network

* Serves as the infrastructure that connects devices to each other and other networks, allowing them to communicate with each other

# Cable Types

## Ethernet

An Ethernet cable is a type of networking cable commonly used to connect devices within a LAN

* Designed for transmitting data between networking devices
* Typically uses twisted pair conductors to carry electrical signals

## Twisted Pair

A twisted pair cable consists of four pairs of insulated copper wires twisted together that transmits data using electrical signals

* The twisting of the wires helps to reduce eletromagnetic interference from external sources and crosstalk between adjacent pairs, improving the cable's performance and reliability
* Susceptible to eavesdropping

### Unshielded Twisted Pair

* More flexible and cost effective since they don't have additional shielding around the twisted pairs
* Commonly used for Ethernet connections in LANs
* Supports various data rates (Ex: *10 Mbps*, *100 Mbps*, *1000 Mbps*, *etc.*) and standards (Ex: *Fast Ethernet*, *GigabitEthernet*, *etc.*) 

### Shielded Twisted Pair

* Helps further reduce electromagnetic interference and provides better protection against external noise since it has additional shielding around the twisted pairs that are typically made out of metal foil or braided wire
* Commonly used in environments with high levels of electromagnetic interference (Ex: *Industrial areas with a lot of electrical equipment*, *etc.*)
* Less susceptible to electromagnetic interference and crosstalk compared to UTP cables but are generally more expensive and less flexible

## Fiber Optic

A fiber optic cable is a type of cable that transmits data as pulses of light signals over long distances

* Consists of one or more thin strands of glass or plastic fibers surrounded by a protective outer layer
* The core of each fiber is designed to carry light signals
* The outer cladding is designed to reflect the light inward in order to help prevent signal loss or leakage
* More suitable for transmitting large amounts of data over long distances since it can support higher bandwidth compared to copper cables
* Allows for longer transmission distances without the need for signal boosting or regeneration since the light signals transmitted through fiber optic cables experience minimal signal loss
* Suitable for environments with high levels of electrical noise since they're not affected by electromagnetic interference from external sources
* Provides greater security for data transmission compared to copper cables since they're more difficult to tap into or intercept
* Easier to install and handle compared to bulky copper cables

## Coaxial 

A coaxial cable is a type of electrical cable consisting of a central conductor, an insulating layer, a metallic shield, and an outer insulating layer that transmits data using electrical signals

# Leased Lines

Leased lines are a type of dedicated telecommunication line that provides a constant and direct connection between two locations

* Uses serial cables
