# Metrics Overview

A metric is a quantitative measurement that represents some aspect of the performance, health, or usage of a resource or service

* Used to monitor the behavior of resources and services

<br>

# Metric Kinds

## GAUGE

GAUGE represents the value of a measurement at a specific instant in time (*CPU utilization*, *Memory usage*, *etc.*)

<br>

## DELTA

DELTA measures the change in a value over a time interval (*Number of requests in the last minute*, *etc.*)

* Each value represent increments since the last measurement (Reports the difference since the last observation)
* Each value is independent and doesn't accumulate over time

<br>

## CUMULATIVE

CUMULATIVE represents a running total since a fixed start time (*Total bytes sent*, *Total requests served*, *etc.*)

* Always increases and only restarts on reset 
* Each value shows the total since the metric collection started
