# Kinesis Services

* Makes it easier to collect, process, and analyze real-time stream data so that users can get timely insights and react quickly to new information
* Can ingest real-time data and process data as it arrives

## Kinesis Data Streams

Kinesis Data Streams is a highly scalable real-time data streaming service that's designed to capture, process, and store large streams of data records in real time as it arrives

* Designed to continuously capture gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sources that usually become available in milliseconds
* Enables users to build applications that require continuous data ingestion and real-time processing from multiple sources
* Ensures high durability and availability by storing captured data records across multiple AZs in a region for up to a year
* Designed to simplify the real-time collection and processing of data streams by managing the infrastructure, storage, networking, and configuration needed to process large streams of data

## Kinesis Video Streams

Kinesis Video Streams is a fully managed service designed to securely stream video from connected devices to AWS for analytics, ML, and other processing

* Enables users to build applications that can play, process, and analyze video streams in real-time

## Kinesis Data Firehose

Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service designed to automatically capture, transform, and load streaming data into AWS services for near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools

* Simplifies the process of loading large amounts of streaming data into data lakes, data stores, and analytics services
* Enables users to transform their data before loading it into the destination by calling an AWS Lambda function to transform incoming data or convert the data format before storing it
* Scales automatically to accommodate the volume of incoming data
* Enables users to reduce storage costs and enhance data security by supporting data compression and ecryption

## Kinesis Data Analytics

Kinesis Data Analytics is a fully managed service that enables users to easily write SQL queries or build Apache Flink applications to process and analyze streaming data
