AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that's provided by AWS

* Collects and stores metrics (Ex: *CPU utilization*, *Network traffic*, *Disk usage*, *etc.*) from various AWS services (Ex: *Amazon EC2*, *Amazon S3*, *Amazon RDS*, *etc.*)
* Allows users to collect, monitor, and store log files generated by AWS resources and applications in real-time (CloudWatch Logs)
* Allows users to create customizable dashboards to visualize metrics and logs data from different AWS resources and applications
* Enables users to set thresholds on metrics and trigger notifications or automated actions when those thresholds are breached
* Provides a stream of system events (Ex: *Instance state changes*, *API calls*, *Schedule events*, *etc.*) that occur within AWS resources (CloudWatch Events)
* Allows users to monitor the availability and performance of their application by simulating user interactions with web applications (CloudWatch Synthetics)
* Uses machine learning algorithms to analyse metric data and automatically detect unusual patterns or anomalies (CloudWatch Anomaly Detection)

# Collected Metrics

* CPU utilization, which measures the percentage of CPU capacity used over a specified time period
* Network traffic, which tracks the incoming and outgoing network traffic, typically in bytes per second, to help identify network bottlenecks or spikes in data transfer
* Disk I/O, which monitors read and write operations to the resource's storage volumes, typically in bytes per second and by measuring the average disk read/write time
* Memory utilization, which measures the percentage of memory (RAM) used by the resource to help identify memory-intensive applications or instances with insufficient memory allocation
* Status check, which tracks the results of resource status checks to help monitor the health of a resource's underlying infrastructure
* Disk space, which monitors the amount of disk space available on a resource's root volume or attached EBS volumes to help prevent storage capacity issues and ensure the availability of sufficient disk space for applications and data
