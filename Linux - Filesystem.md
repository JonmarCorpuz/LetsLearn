The Linux filesystem is the structure and organization that's used to store and retrieve data on Linux-based operating systems

* Follows a hierarchical directory structure

# Linux Filesystem Directories

## /

The **/** directory is the top-level directory from which all other directories stem

## /bin

The **/bin** directory contains the essential binaries required for the system's boot, repair, and basic operations 


## /sbin

The **/sbin** directory contains binaries that are crucial for system maintenance and administrative tasks

## /boot

The **/boot** directory contains bootloader files and the Linux kernel

* Essential for booting the operating system

## /etc

The **/etc** directory contains system-wide configuration files and scripts

## /home

The **/home** directory contains the home directories for regular users

## /lib

## /lib64

## /usr

The **/usr** directory contains binaries, libraries, documentation, and source code for installed programs

## /var

The **/var** directory contains variable data files and data contains data that's expected to grow over time (Ex: *Log files*, *etc.*)

## /tmp 

The **/tmp** directory contains temporary files that are deleted upon reboot

## /opt

The **/opt** directory contains third-party software and add-on packages that are not part of the default installation

## /dev

The **/dev** directory contains device files that represent hardware devices attached to the system and allows user programs and the kernel to communicate with specific hardware devices

## /proc

The **/proc** directory is a virtual filesystem that provides information about processes and system resources

## /sys

## /root

The **/root** directory contains the home directory for the root user

## /mnt

The **/mnt** directory is a temporary mount point for mounting filesystems temporarily

* Used for mounting external storage devices (Ex: *USB*, *SSD*, *etc.*)

## /media
