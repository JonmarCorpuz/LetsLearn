Terminal Controller Access Control System Plus is an enhanced version of TACACS, which is a network protocol designed to provide centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) for network devices 

* Addresses the limitations of the original TACACS protocol (Ex: *Improved security*, *Improved flexibility*, *Improved scalability*, *etc.*)
* Allows administrators to control who can access the network, what resources they can access, and keep track of their activities

# TACACS+ Components

## TACACS+ Client

A TACACS+ client is a network device or software application installed on networking devices that initiates communication with a TACACS+ server to request AAA services for users attempting to access network resources

## TACACS+ Server

A TACACS+ server is a server that's responsible for providing AAA serviecs to network devices and users attempting to access network resources

## TACACS+ Authentication Database

A TACACS+ authentication database is a repository that stores information related to user accounts, access permissions, and authentication credentials used by the TACACS+ server to perform authentication and authorization processes

* Contains records for each user authorized to access the network (Ex: *Usernames*, *Passwords*, *etc.*)
* Able to store access control policies and authorization rules that determine what actions users are allowed to perform on the network
* Able to store encryption keys or certificates used to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information exchanged between TACACS+ clients and servers
* Able to store audit logs and accounting records generated by the TACACS+ server
