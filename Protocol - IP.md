The Internet Protocol is responsible for routing packets of data across networks

* Operates at the Network layer of the OSI model and adds an IP header to the data packet to include additional information (Ex: *Source IP address*, *Destination IP address*, *Packet length*, *etc.*)
* Doesn't guarantee delivery or provide mechanisms for error recovery or flow control since it's connectionless
