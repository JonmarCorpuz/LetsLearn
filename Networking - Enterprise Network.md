# Enterprise Network Architecture

An enterprise network refers to the interconnected IT infrastructure and networking components used by an organization to facilitate communciation, collaboration, and data exchange among its employees, departments, and external stakeholders

* Typically designed to meet the specific needs and requirements of large-scale organizations
* Designed to be scalable

### Enterprise Edge

The Enterprise Edge refers to the part of the network that interfaces with external networks and services (Ex: *Internet*, *Extranets*, *Remote branch offices*, *etc.*)

* Acts as a boundary between the internal network of an organization and the outside world
* Includes various networking devices (Ex: *Firewalls*, *Routers*, *VPN concentrators*, *etc.*)
* Critical for ensuring the security, availability, and performance of network services for an organization

### Service Provider Edge

The Service Provider Edge refers to the part of the network that sits between an organization's internal network and their service provider's network

* Enables and facilitates the interconnection of the SP's network with the organization's internal network
* Responsible for managing and directing traffic within the provider's network to ensure efficient use of network resources and optimal performance for customers (Ex: *Traffic prioritization*, *Traffic shaping*, *Traffic engineering*, *etc.*)
* The Service Provider Edge is where various services offered by the SP are delivered to customers (Ex: *VPNs*, *Internet access*, *etc.*)
* Serves as the entry point to the Sp's network

# Event-Driven Architecture

A Server Farm, also known as a data center or a server cluster, is a centralized facility used to house and manage a large number of servers and associated equipment

An event-driven architecture refers to a network design where systems and applications respond to events or messages generated by the network's resources

* Uses events to invoke and communicate between decouple services

## Event-Driven Architecture Components

### Event Producer

### Event Routers

### Even Consumers
