AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows users to run code without provisioning or managing servers

* Users can upload their code and AWS will take care of everything required to run and scale the code with high availability
* Executes a user's code in response to events/triggers (Event-driven programming model)
* Charges only for the compute time a user's code consumes (Pay-per-use pricing model)
* Automatically scales a user's application by running code in response to each trigger (Automatic scaling)
* Automatically executes a user's code securely within a dedicated execution environment, which is isolated from other functions (Integrated security model)
* Supports various programming languages and custom runtimes, and is more suited for quick processing (Ex: *Web backend handling request*, *Backend report processing service*, *Microservice hosting*, *etc.*)
