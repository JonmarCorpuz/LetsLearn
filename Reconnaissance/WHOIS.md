# WHOIS Overview

`whois` queries for the specified domain's registrant and owner's information (*Mailing address*, *Phone number*, *Email address*, etc.*) to a domain registrar

* Domain owners may use a third-party service called **Domain Privacy** to hide some of their information by replacing them with that of a forwarding service
