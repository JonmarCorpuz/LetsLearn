# Reconnaissance Techniques

## Google Dorking

## Certificate Parsing

* An SSL certificate's `Subject Alternative Name` field lets certificate owners specify additional hostnames that use the same certificate

## Subdomain Enumeration

## Service Enumeration

## Directory Enumeration

* Allows you to learn more about the structure and technology of an application (Ex: *A pathname that includes phpmyadmin usually means that the application is built with PHP*)

## Web Crawling

Web crawling is a process used to identify all pages on a website

* Allows users to potentially uncover many hidden endpoints in an application by identifying all the URLs embedded on the page and then visiting them

## Third-Party Hosting 

* Looking for a company's third party hosting footprint
* Their resources on third-party hosting services can sometimes contain useful information (Ex: *Backups*, *Source code*, *Credentials*, *Logs*, *Hidden endpoints*, *etc.*)
