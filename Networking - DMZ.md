A Demilitarized Zone is a section of an organization's network that's isolated from their internal network and external network

* Provides an additional layer of security by placing public-facing systems and services that need to be accessible by third-parties from the internet in an intermediary zone with restricted access
* Acts as a buffer zone between an organization's internal network and the external network, helping to protect critical internal resources from potential attacks
* Contains specific firewall rules to protect an organization's internal network from unauthorized access and limit access to the DMZ servers for only their intended purpose
