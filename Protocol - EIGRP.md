The EIGRP protocol is an advanced distance-vector routing protocol, which is a protocol that's used to determine the best path for data packets based on distance metrics, that's used on a network for automating routing decisions and configuration

* Reduces network traffic and speeds up convergence, which is the time it takes for all routers in the network to have a consistent view of the network, by sending updates only when there are changes in the network topology
* Prevents routing loops using techinques such as route poisoning, split horizon, and holddown timers
* Provides more precise and efficient route selection based on current network conditions (Ex: *Bandwidth*, *Hop count*, *etc.*)
* Can enhance network performance by spreading traffic across several paths to avoid overloading any single route
* Can manage large routing tables and reduce the amount of routing information that must be processed and stored by routers by supporting features such as route summarization and route aggregation
