Availability refers to the ability of a network or service to be accessible and usable when needed

* Expressed as a percentage representing the amount of time a network or service is operational comapred to the total time in a given period

# High Availability Factors

## Redundancy

Redundancy is the duplication of critical components, pathways, or resources within a network infrastructure to ensure continued operation in the event of a failure

* The goal is to increase reliability and availability by mitigating the impact of hardware or software failures
* Reduces the risk of downtime
* Ensures that critical services remain available and accessible to users in the face of any failures

## Fault Tolerance

Fault tolerance is the ability of a system to continue operating properly in the event of a failure

* Ensures that if one component fails, another takes over seamlessly to maintain continuous operation

## Resiliency

Resiliency is the ability for a network or system to withstand and recover from disruptions, failures, or unexpected events while maintaining its functionality and performance

# Availability Types

## Active-Passive

An active-passive system has only one of the two resources available at a time

## Active-Active

An active-active system has both resources available

* The second resource can be used for load balancing, allowing the entire system to take more load
