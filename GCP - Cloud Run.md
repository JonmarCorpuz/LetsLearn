Cloud Run is a serverless platform that allows users to run containerized applications in a fully managed environment without having to worry about server provisioning, management, scaling, and maintenance

* Deploys containers within seconds without users having to create a cluster for their containers
* The service name and region isn't changeable after you've created a service
* Built on top of the Knative open standard, which is a platform that extends Kubernetes to provide a set of middleware components for building, deploying, and managing cloud-native applications
* Charges only for the resources that were used and requires zero infrastructure management
