The Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (**802.1S**) is an extension and enhancement of the STP and its variants that allows for the creation of multiple spanning tree instances on a network that each correspond to different VLANs

* Can group multiple VLANs into different instances for easier configuration and management (Ex: *VLANs 1 to 5 in instance 1*, *etc.*)
