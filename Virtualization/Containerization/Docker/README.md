# Docker Overview

* Docker containers don't need a guest OS to run since all Docker containers share the underlying kernel (Unlike in VMs where each VM has their own kernel in order to be isolated from each other and run), which is why they're also lightweight 
* Containers virtualize the OS (Unlike in virtualization where it virtualizes the hardware)
* You can only install Linux based containers on a Linux system and vice-versa
