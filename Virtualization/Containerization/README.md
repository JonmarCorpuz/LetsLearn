Containerization is a software deployment process that bundles an application's code with all the files and dependencies it needs to run on any infrastructure

# Containers

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another

* Portable and can be deployed on multiple OS environments
* Provides a consistent environment
* Lightweight software components that run efficiently and can be quickly launched since it doesn't need to boot an OS
* All containers on the same host uses computing resources from the same shared OS but each container are isolated and won't interfere with the operations of other containers
* Provides better resource control

## Microservices

A microservice is an independent and isolated component of an application

* Microservices can be modified without interfering with the OS, hardware, or other application services
