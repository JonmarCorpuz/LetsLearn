Cloud computing is a model for delivering and enabling the consumption of configurable computing services over the Internet usually through a Cloud Service Provider

* Instead of hosting and running applications or storing data on local servers or the Internet, users can access and use computing resources over the Internet from an always-on environment using an as-needed or as-consumed model 
* Resources can be scaled up or down as per business needs and requirements by allowing an organization to consume services in an elastic utility model as needed 
* Offers on-demand services that can be bought and used with little configuration within a few minutes (Pay-as-you-go)
* Requires limited human interaction 
* Allows organizations to consistently access the resources they need with minimal interruption
* Designed to remain available despite system failures
* Offers IT resources only one click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to minutes
* Allows you to deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks, providing lower latency and a better experience for your customers at a minimal cost
