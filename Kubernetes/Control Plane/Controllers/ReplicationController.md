# ReplicationController Overview

* Provides high availability by helping run multile instances of a single pod in a K8 cluster
* Ensures that the specified number of pods are running all the time (Automatically brings up a new pod when the existing one fails)
* Spans across multiple nodes in a K8 cluster (Helps balance the load across multiple pods on different nodes and scale an application when demand increases)
* Slowly becoming replaced by replica sets
