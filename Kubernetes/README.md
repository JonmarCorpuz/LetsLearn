# Kubernetes Overview

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform 

* Automates the deployment, scaling, and management of clusters and the containers within
* Makes an application highly available by ensuring that its nodes are healthy
* Makes an application scalable by allowing workloads to be scaled horizontally and vertically to match demand
* Highly portable, meaning that it can be run anywhere with nearly any type of infrastructure
* Allows you to simply declare the final, desired state of your workload and then Kubernetes will figure out how to get there
* Monitors the state of the Kubernetes cluster and the desired final state that was declared in the configuration file

# Microservices

* Scalable applications are often written as collections of microservices (In the past, many applications were monolithic or designed to include all functionality in a single compiled program or script)
* Allows developers to change one service and roll it out without impacting other services by dividing application code into single-function applications
