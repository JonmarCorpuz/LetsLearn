The Border Gateway Protocol is an exterior gateway protocol used in large-scale networks to enable the exchange of routing and reachability information between autonomous systems

* The most scalable routing protocol
* Designed for use between different autonomous systems to allow them to communicate with each other
* Makes routing decisions based on paths, policies, and network policies
* Enables ISPs to connect their networks to the rest of the internet by advertising the routes to their networks, allowing the routers on the internet to dynaically exchange routing information, adapt to changes in network topology, and ensure efficient and reliable packet delivery

# BGP Components

## BGP Speakers

A BGP speaker is any network device that's capable of running the BGP protocol

* Echanges routing information with each other to make routing decisions about how to route traffic between different networks or ASes
