Amazon Elastic Block Store is a block storage service that allows users to create and attach persistent block storage volumes to Amazon EC2 instances, which provide durable, low-latency storage that can be used as primary storage for data, applications, and OSes running on EC2 instances

* Amazon EBS volumes persist independently of the lifecycle of the EC2 instance to which they're attached, meaning that data stored on EBS volumes remains intact even if the associated EC2 instance is stopped, terminated, or replaced
* Provides block-level storage, allowing EBS volumes to be formatted and used like physical hard drives
* Designed for high availability and durability, along with built-in redundancy and replication across multiple AZs within an AWS Region
