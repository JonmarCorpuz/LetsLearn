# Cloud Memorystore Overview

Cloud Memorystore is a managed service for caching frequently used data in memory 

* Designed to provide submillisecond access to data
* Protocol-compatible with both Redis and Memcached (Any tool and application written to work with either should work with Memorystore)
* Allows users to specify the size of a cache while leaving administration tasks to Google
* Can be used with applications running in Compute Engine, App Engine, and Kubernetes Engine
