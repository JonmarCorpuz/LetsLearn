# Connectivity Tests

[Connectivity Tests](https://cloud.google.com/network-intelligence-center/docs/connectivity-tests/concepts/overview) is a diagnostics tool that lets you check connectivity between network endpoints

* Analyzes your network configurations between the endpoints by simulating the expected forwarding path of a packet through your VPC network, Cloud VPN tunnels, or VLAN attachments
* Can also simulate the expected inbound forwarding path to resources in your VPC network
* Can also perform live data plane analysis
