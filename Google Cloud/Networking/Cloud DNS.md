# Internal DNS

Internal DNS refers to a managed service that provides DNS name resolution within the same Google Cloud network

* Allows resources to communicate with each other using internal hostnames rather than IP addresses (These hostnames are only reservable within the VPC or across connected VPCs through VPC sharing or shared VPCs)
* DNS queries for internal hostnames are only resolvable with the VPC (Isolates internal communication from the public internet)
* Ensures that applications and services within Google Cloud can efficiently locate and communicate with each other securely and reliably
