## Network Flow

A network flow refers to a sequence of packets sharing common properties that travel between a source and a destination over a network

* The packets are grouped into flows based on certain criteria (*IP address*, *Destination IP address*, *Source port*, *Destination port*, *Transport protocol used*, *etc.*)
