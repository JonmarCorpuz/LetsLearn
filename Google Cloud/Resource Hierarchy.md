## Organization

* The root of the resource hierarchy (Typically corresponds to a company or organization)

## Folders

* Folders are the building blocks of multilayer organizational hierarchies
* Either contains projects, other folders, or both

## Projects

A project within GCP is a logical grouping of Google Cloud Resources

* This is where we create resources, use Google Cloud services, manage permissions, and manage billing options
* Anyone with the `resourcemanager.projects.create` IAM permission can create a project (When an organization is created, every user in the domain is granted that permission by default)
