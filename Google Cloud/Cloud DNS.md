# Cloud DNS Overview

Google's Cloud DNS is a managed DNS service provided by GCP that allows users to host their DNS zones and manage DNS records for their domain names without having to run their own DNS servers

* Designed to automatically scale so customers can have as many domains as they want without concern for scaling the underlying infrastructure
