# Persistent Disk Overview



* Provides block storage on SSDs and HDDs (SSDs are often used for low-latency applications where persistent disk performance is important and HDDs are used for applications that can tolerate longer read and write times and require large amounts of persistent disk storage)
* Supports multiple readers without a degradation in performance in order to allow multiple instances to read a single copy of data
* Can also be resized as needed while in use without the need to restart your VMs
