# IAP Overview

* Allows you to use an application-level access control model (*Group-based application access*, *etc.*) instead of relying on network-level firewalls by letting you establish a central authorization layer for applications accessed by HTTPS (Ex: *A resource could be accessible for employees and inaccessible for contractors*, *etc.*)
* Used when you want to enforce access control policies for applications and resources
* Works with [signed headers](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/signed-headers-howto) or the App Engine standard environment [Users API](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/services/users) to secure your app
