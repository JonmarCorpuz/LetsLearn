## Object Storage

Object storage is a system that manages the use of storage in terms of object or blobs

* Each object is stored in a bucket, which are individually addressable by a URL
* Object storage is not limited by the size of disks or SSDs since they're stored on the cloud
* Multiple copies of objects are stored across multiple zones and sometimes regions to improve availability and durability
