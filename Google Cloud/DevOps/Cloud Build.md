# Cloud Build Overview

Cloud Build (Cloud Deploy) is a CI/CD platform that automates your software build, test, and deploy processes

* Automates the building of your software packages, compiling of source code, running tests, and producing of software artifacts that are ready for deployment in order to help developers to quickly build and deliver applications
* Integrates seamlessly with source repositories to trigger builds automatically when a change is committed to the repository (*GitHub*, *Bitbucket*, *etc.*)
* Can deploy your applications to various cloud services (*App Engine*, *Cloud Functions*, *Cloud Run*, *GKE*, *Firebase*, *etc.*)
* Scales automatically with your build demands
* Builds run in a virtual environment and are isolated from other cloud resources
