# Scoping Project 

A scoping project is a project that acts as a monitoring scope for each folder

* This is recommended practice
* Each scoping project would be configured to include resources and metrics exclusively from the corresponding folder (Ensures that dashboards are dedicated to specific segments of your organization's structure in order to make the monitored data more organized and easier to analyze)
