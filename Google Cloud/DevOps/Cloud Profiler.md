# Cloud Profiler Overview

Cloud Profiler is a performance analysis tool that helps developers collect and analyze CPU and memory usage from applications running in production

* CPU and memory data is gathered continuously while having very low impact on performance (This makes it suitable for always-on profiling in live environments)
* Continuously gathers profiling data with minimal overhead
