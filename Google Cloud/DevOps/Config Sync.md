# Config Sync Overview

Config Sync is a feature that lets users manage the configurations of their Kubernetes clusters using a declarative approach

* Allows users to keep their cluster configuration in sync with configurations stored in a Git repository
* Ensures consistency, repeatability, and traceability for deploying applications and managing cluster settings
* Uses the user's Git repository as the source of truth for their cluster configurations (Continuously monitors their Git repository for changes and automatically applies any updates to their clusters)
