# VPC Firewall Rules

* Defined at the network level
* Used to control the flow of network traffic to VMs
* Stateful, meaning that if traffic is allowed in one direction and a connection is established, then it's allowed in the other direction as well (Ex: *If an SSH connection on port 22 is allowed, then all later traffic matching this rule is permitted as long as the connection is active*)

## Direction

## Priority

* Highest-priority rules are applied over any other matching rule that has a lower priority
