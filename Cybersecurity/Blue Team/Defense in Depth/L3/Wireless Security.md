# Wireless Security Overview

* It's important to encrypt wireless traffic sent between the wireless clients and the AP because wireless signals aren't contained within a wire, meaning that any device within range of the signal can receive the traffic
* All devices on the WLAN will use the same encryption protocol, however each client will use a unique encryption/decryption key so that other devices can't read its traffic
* A group key is used by an AP to encrypt traffic that it wants to send to all of its clients (All of the clients associated with the AP keep that key so that they can decrypt the traffic)
* A Message Integrity Check (MIC) is added to messages to help protect their integrity
