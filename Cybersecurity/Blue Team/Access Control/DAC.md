# Discretionary Access Control Overview

DAC is a security model that regulates access to resources based on the discretion of resource owners

* Resource owners have full control over who can access their resources and what level of access is granted
* Resource owners have the authority to set access permissions for that resource (Ex: *Read*, *Write*, *Execute*, *etc.*)
