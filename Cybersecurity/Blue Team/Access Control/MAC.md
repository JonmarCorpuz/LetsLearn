# Mandatory Access Control Overview

MAC is a security model that enforces access control policies based on a system of security labels and access rules defined by a central authority

* A security label is a label that indicates a network resource or asset's sensitivity or classification level and is typically represented as security clearances, security classifications, or sensitivity levels
* Access rules are predefined rules that dictate which users or processes can access specific resources based on their security labels (Access decisions are made by comparing the security labels of the user and the requested resource against the access rules defined by the central authority)
