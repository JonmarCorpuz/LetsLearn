* Divided into six levels

| Pyramid of Pain Level | | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hash Value | Trivial | The unique digital fingerprint of a file |
| IP Addresses | Easy | Indicates from where an attack originates |
| Domain Names | Simple | The name of websites or other network resources used by threat actors |
| Network/Host Artifacts | Annoying | Specific configurations or attributes of network traffic or host systems |
| Tools | Challenging | The software and scripts used by the threat actors |
| TTPs | Tough! | The methodologies and strategies that are used by threat actors |

# Hash Value

* Can be easily modified by threat actors
* Used to gain insight into a specific malware sample, a malicious or a suspicious file, and as a way to uniqely identify and reference a malicious artifact
