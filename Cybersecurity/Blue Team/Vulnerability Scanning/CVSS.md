# CVSS

Common Vulnerability Scoring System is a framework for rating the severity of security vulnerabilities

* Provides a numerical score that reflects the overall risk posed by a vulnerability
* CVSS scores range from 0 to 10 (Higher scores indicate more severe vulnerabilities)

# VPR

Vulnerability Priority Rating is a scoring system that's used to prioritize the remediation of vulnerabilities based on their risk and potential impact

* Risk-driven
* Risk to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data does not play a large factor in scoring vulnerabilities
## VPR Ratings 

| VPR Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Low | 0.0 - 3.9 |
| Medium | 4.0 - 6.9 |
| High | 7.0 - 8.9 |
| Critical | 9.0 - 10.0 |
