# Web Reputation Filter Process

1. **Website Analysis**: When a user attempts to access a website, the web reputation filter will examine various attributes of the website (Ex: *Domain name*, *IP address*, *Content*, *Historical behavior*, *etc.* 

2. **Reputation Scoring**: Based on the previous analysis, the filter will assign a reputation score to the website, which will indicate the level of trustworthiness or risk associated with the site (Ex: *Positive reputation are likely safe to visit*, *Negative reputation may be potentially harmful*, *etc.*)

3. **Categorization**: The filer then categorizes the website into a group based on its reputation score and content (Ex: *Safe*, *Malicious*, *Suspicious*, *Phishing*, *Spam*, *etc.*)

4. **Access Control**: The web reputation filter may take an additional step and block access or restrict access to the website if it has a negative reputation score using predefined rules
