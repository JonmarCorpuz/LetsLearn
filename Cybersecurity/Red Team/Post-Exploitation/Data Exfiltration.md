# Data Exfiltration Overview

Data Exfiltration is the process of taking an unauthorized copy of sensitive data and moving it from the inside of an organization to the outside while potentially bypassing certain security products and features at the same time

# Types of Data Exfiltration

## Traditional Data Exfiltration

Traditional Data Exfiltration is simply a one-way data extraction from inside a network to the outside

* A threat actor can make one or more network requests to transfer the target data
* Since this is a one-way extraction, the threat actor won't care about any protocol replies or responses to their request

## C2 Communications 

C2 Data Exfiltration is a two-way process where communication goes in and out of a network

* Some C2 frameworks provide options to establish a communication channel through either standard or non-traditional protocols to send commands to the compromised machines within a network and receive their responses

## Tunnelling 

Tunnelling is when a threat actor establishes a communication channel between their machine and their victim's machine

* The established communication channel will act as a bridge to let the threat actor's machine access the entire internal network of their target
* Tunnelling will allow the threat actor to continuously send and receive traffic
