Google Cloud Logging is a fully managed service for collecting, storing, and analyzing logs from your Google Cloud resources and applications

* Fully managed (Ex: *No server provisioning*, *No patching*, *etc.*)
* Most GCP managed services automatically send logs to Cloud Logging 
* Helps you monitor and troubleshoot your systems by providing visibility into log data generated by your applications and cloud infrastructure by collecting and aggregating logs from various Google Cloud services into a central location
* Provides immediate insights into the performance and behaviors of your applications and infrastructure by capturing and analyzing log data in real time
* Stores logs securely with configurable retention periods
* Allows you to configure alerts based on specific log patterns or thesholds, as well as store, search, and analyze on massive volume of data
* Allows you to implement control and permissions to ensure that only authorized users can view or manage logs
