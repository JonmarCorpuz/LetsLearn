Google Cloud Logging is a fully managed service for collecting, storing, and analyzing logs from your Google Cloud resources and applications

* Fully managed (Ex: *No server provisioning*, *No patching*, *etc.*)
* Most GCP managed services automatically send logs to Cloud Logging 
* Helps you monitor and troubleshoot your systems by providing visibility into log data generated by your applications and cloud infrastructure by collecting and aggregating logs from various Google Cloud services into a central location
* Provides immediate insights into the performance and behaviors of your applications and infrastructure by capturing and analyzing log data in real time
* Stores logs securely with configurable retention periods
* Allows you to configure alerts based on specific log patterns or thesholds, as well as store, search, and analyze on massive volume of data
* Allows you to implement control and permissions to ensure that only authorized users can view or manage logs
* Allows you to route logs to specific log buckets based on filters
* Logs can be exported to a Cloud Storage bucket for long term retention

# Log Bucket

A log bucket is a storage container within Cloud Logging that holds log entries

* Provides a structured and organized way to manage and store log data from various sources
* Allows you to create different buckets for different logging purposes in order to organize your logs
* Allows you to define retention policies that determine how long logs are kept before they're deleted

| Log Bucket Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| _Required | Holds Admin activity, System Events, and Access Transparency logs |
| _Default | Holds all other logs that aren't stored in the _Required bucket |

## _Required Log Bucket

* Free and can't be deleted
* The retention period is 400 days be default and can't be changed

## _Default Log Bucket

* You're billed based on Cloud Logging pricing
* The bucket can't be deleted but you can disable the _Default log sink route to disable log ingestion
* The retention period is 30 days by default and can be edited to be between 1 and 3650 days
