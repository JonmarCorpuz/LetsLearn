# Cloud Computing Services

| Cloud Computing Service | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Infrastructure as a Service | |
| Platfrom as a Service | |
| Software as a Service | |

## Infrastructure as a Service

IaaS enables consumers to use virtualized computing resources offered by a CSP over the Internet (*Virtual machines*, *Data storage*, etc.) 

* Consumers don't manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but have control over the OS, middleware, runtime, data, and applications that they want to deploy
* Consumers can purchase a basic computing hardware platform and then build their solutions on top of that

## Platform as a Service

PaaS provides a platform created by a CSP that enables consumers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure 

* Consumers don't manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but have control over the data and applications that they want to deploy
* Enables consumers to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or consumer-acquired applications that were created using programming languages and tools that are supported by the CSP
* Consumers can rapidly deploy their applications quickly without having to purchase and install their own servers and associated equipment

## Software as a Service

SaaS enables consumers to access software applications that are offered by a CSP via the cloud without having to host the software on their machines 

* Consumers don't manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure
* The CSP has complete responsibility for the management and support of their applications
* All networking, processing, storage, and applications are offered as a service in this model

# Communications as a Service

CaaS enables consumers to access communication services and features over the Internet (Ex: *Video conferencing*, *Instant messaging*, *E-mail*, *Collaboration*, *etc.*)

* New features can be quickly implemented
* There's no need for a staff to manage the communication services since the CaaS CSP will take responsibility
* Also known as the Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS)

# Anything as a Service

XaaS provides consumers access to any service

# Desktop as a Service

DaaS enables consumers to access virtual desktop environments over the Internet

* Provides consumers with a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), where all of its applications are hosted in the cloud and can consist of any type of application
* DaaS CSPs manage all the maintenance and configurations as well as licensing and version updates

# Business Process as a Service

BPaaS enables businesses to leverage external expertise and technology to streamline and optimize specific business processes without having to build and maintain those processes in-house

* A specialized area that outsources many of a company's day-to-day operations to the cloud (Ex: *Inventory*, *Shipping*, *Supply chain*, *Finance*, *etc.*)
* Similar to SaaS except it focuses specifically on applications that support a company's business operations
* Enables small and medium-sized businesses to access sometimes very expensive applications from a BPaaS service provider that pools its resources and allows for economies of scale in providing these services
