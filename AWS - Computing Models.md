# Virtual Servers

Virtual servers are servers that offer resizable compute capacity in the cloud (Ex: *AWS EC2*

* Allows users to launch virtual servers (Instances) with various configurations to meet their specific computing needs
* There exists many different instance types for different use cases (Ex: *General-purpose computing*, *Memory-intensive applications*, *Compute-intensive workloads*, *Storage-optimized tasks*, *etc.*)
* Can be easily scaled up or down to match changing workload demands
* Can be deployed across multiple AZs within a region to achieve high availability and fault tolerance

# Serverless

Serverless refers to a cloud computing model where AWS manages the infrastructure and servers dynamically (Ex: *AWS Lambda*)

* Allows users to focus solely on writing and deploying code without the need to provision or manage servers directly
* Event-driven and scales automatically, meaning that resources are allocated dynamically as needed, and users are billed only for the actual resources consumed during code execution

# Containers

The container computing model refers to the packaging of applications and its dependencies into a container (Ex: *AWS ECS*, *AWS EKS*, *AWS Fargate*, *AWS ECR*)

* Allows for easier deployment, scaling, and management

# Managed Platform as a Service

The Managed PaaS computing model refers to fully managed services that abstract away infrastructure management and provide platforms for building, deploying, and managing applications (Ex: *AWS Elastic Beanstalk*, *AWS App Runner*, *AWS Amplify*, *AWS CloudFormation*, *AWS Managed Services*)

* Allows developers to focus on building and deploying applications by abstracting away much of the complexity associated with infrastructure management
* Offers scalability, reliability, and ease of use
* Reduces operational overhead, improves time-to-market, and increases agility in deploying applications

# Batch Processing and Big Data

The batch processing and big data computing model involves leveraging cloud-based services and tools to process and analyze large volumes of data efficiently (Ex: *AWS EMR*, *AWS Glue*, *AWS Redshift*, *AWS Athena*, *AWS Batch*, *AWS Kinesis*)

* Enables data-driven decision-making and unlocking new business opportunities by efficiently processing, analysing, and deriving insights from large volumes of data
* Highly scalable, reliable, and cost-effective

# Edge Computing 

Edge computing refers to the process of processing data closer to the source of data generation rather than relying solely on centralized data centers or cloud infrastructure (Ex: *AWS Outposts*, *AWS Wavelength*, *AWS IoT Greengrass*, *AWS CloudFront*, *AWS Snow Family*)

* Helps reduce latency, minimize data transfer costs, improve reliability, and enable real-time decision-making for applications and services by deploying them closer to end-users and devices
