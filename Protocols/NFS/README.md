# NFS Overview

[Network File System](https://www.lenovo.com/ca/en/glossary/network-file-system-nfs/?orgRef=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F) is a protocol that allows you to access and manage files over a network as if they were local files

* Commonly used in Linux and UNIX environments and enables seamless file sharing across different systems by using a server-client model
* Works by using a client to request access to a file or directory from an NFS server, which the server than processes the request, granting permissions and enabling the client to read or write to the file, depending on the access controls in place
* Offers centralized data management, easy file sharing, and reduced storage redundancy by allowing users to access and manage files from multiple devices without duplicating data, which saves storage space and simplifies backups
* Can handle large files
