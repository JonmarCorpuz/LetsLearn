# Maximum Transmission Unit Overview

# Path MTU Discovery

The [Path Maximum Transmission Discovery Unit]() (PMTU) is a standardized technique in computer networking for determining the MTU size on the network path between two IP hosts, usually with the goal of avoiding IP fragmentation

* Works by setting the Don't Fragment (DF) flag in the IP headers of outgoing packets
