# Cluster Overview

A cluster refers to a group of interconnected computers or servers that work together to perform a specific set of tasks or provide a particular service

* A cluster is done through a process called clustering, which is a technique used to enhance the availability, reliability, and performance of IT systems by distributing the workload across multiple machines
* Clusters can be configured in various ways to achieve different goals (Ex: *Load balancing*, *Fault tolerance*, *Scalability*, *etc.*)

# Cluster Types

## High Availability Cluster

A group of interconnected assets that work together to provide uninterrupted services and minimize downtime in the event of an asset failure

* The primary goal is to ensure high availability and reliability of applications and services
* Multiple nodes are configured to work together in such a way that if one node fails or experiences a problem, another node can take over and continue providing the services without interruption
