# IS-IS Overview

The Intermediate System to Intermediate System is a link-state routing protocol used within ISP networks and large enterprise networks to exchange routing information between routers in a network

* Falls into the category of IGPs
* Designed for use within a single AS
* Builds a detailed and accurate map of a network's topology by exchanging information about reachable network nodes and links with neighboring routers 
* Each router maintains a Link-State Database, which is a database of the network topology
