* A simpler version of the FTP and used where simplicity and speed are more critical than advanced features and security
* Doesn't require user authentication, which makes it faster and easier to configure
* Faster but less reliable since it operates over UDP and lacks built-in security features (Ex: *No encryption*, *No secure authentication methods*, *etc.*)
* Commonly used for transferring small amounts of data (Ex: *Configuration files*, *Firmware updates*, *etc.*)
* Widely used for networking booting of devices (Ex: *Loading an OS*, *Initial device configuration*, *etc.*)
