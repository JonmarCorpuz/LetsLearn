# VPC Overview

A Virtual Private Cloud network is a virtual version of a physical network

* Connects GCP resources to each other and to the Internet
* GCP VPC networks are global and can have subnets in any GCP region worldwide
* Isolated by default
* Resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other using internal IPs as long as firewall rules allow it
* Resources in a VPC can only communicate with other resources within another VPC using internal IP addresses only if there's a mechanism in place for them to do so (*VPC Peering*, *VPNs*, *etc.*)
