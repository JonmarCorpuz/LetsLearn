The Trivial File Transfer Protocol allows files to be transferred over a network

* A simpler version of the FTP
* Used where simplicity and speed are more critical than advanced features and security
* Doesn't require user authentication, which makes it faster and easier to configure
* Faster but less reliable since it operates over UDP
* Commonly used for transferring small amounts of data
* Lacks built-in security features (Ex: *No encryption*, *No secure authentication methods*, *etc.*)
