* High-speed, highly redundant, and completely dedicated to interconnecting storage devices
* Facilitates efficient and centralized storage management, enabling multiple servers to access storage resources as if they were locally attached
* Operates at the block level, which are fixed-size chunks of data within storage devices
* Uses different protocols to enable communication between servers and storage devices (Ex: *Fibre Channel*, *Fibre Channel over Ethernet*, *Internet Small Computer System*, *etc.*)
