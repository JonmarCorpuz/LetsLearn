Quality of Service refers to the ability to prioritize and manage network traffic to ensure that certain types of data packets receive preferential treatment over others

* Helps improve performance, reliability, and predictability of network services (Ex: *Minimize delay*, *Minimize packet loss*, *etc.*)
* Enables cost savings as well as more advanced features for voice and video traffic (Ex: *Integration with collaboration software*, *etc.*)
* Offers a set of tools used by networks to apply different treatments to different packets (Ex: *Reserve a certain amount of a link's bandwidth for specific kinds of traffic*, *etc.*)

# QoS Management

## Bandwidth 

The bandwidth refers to the overall capacity of a link

* Measured in bits per second (Ex: *Kbps*, *Mbps*, *Gbps*, *etc.*)

## Delay

The delay refers to a one-way delay, which is the amount of time it takes for traffic to go from source to destination

* Can also refer to a two-way delay, which is the amount of time it takes for traffic to go from source to destination and return

## Jitter

The jitter refers to the variation in one-way delay between packets sent by the same application (The difference in how long it takes between different packets from the same source to reach the same destination)

* Can negatively affect the audio quality of phone calls

## Loss

The loss refers to the percentage of packets sent that don't reach their destination

* Can be cause by faulty cables or a congested network (Ex: *If a device's packet queues get full it'll start discarding packets*, *etc.*)
* Can negatively affect the audio quality of phone calls
