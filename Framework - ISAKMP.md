The Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol is a protocol framework that defines the procedures and packet formats usd for establishing, negotiating, modifying, and deleting SAs between peers in an IPsec VPN

* Defines the overall framework for key management and SA establishment (Ex: *Payloads for exchanging key generation and authentication data*, *etc.*)
* ISAKMP formats provide a consistent framework for transferring key and authentication data independent of the key generation technique, encryption algorithm, and authentication mechanism

## Initiator Cookie

The Intiator Cookie field contains a random value generated by the initiator of the ISAKMP exchange

* Serves as a unique ID for the exchange
* Helps prevent replay attacks by ensuring that each exchange is unique

## Responder Cookie

The Responder Cookie field contains a random value generated by the responder of the ISAKMP exchange

* Serves as a unique ID for the exchange
* * Helprs prevent replay attacks by ensuring that each exchange is unique

## Next Payload

The Next Payload field indicates the type of the next payload in the ISAKMP message

* Specifies the type of data that follows the ISAKMP header (Ex: *SA payload*, *KE payload*, *ID payload*, *etc.*)

## Major Version

The Major Version field indicates the major version number of the ISAKMP protocol that's being used

* Allows peers to negotiate compatibility
* Ensures that both parties support the same version of the protocol

## Minor Version

The Minor Version field indicates the minor version number of the ISAKMP protocol that's being used

* Helps peers negotiate compatibility 

## Exchange Type

The Exchange Type field indicates the type of ISAKMP exchange that's being performed (Ex: *Main mode*, *Agressive mode*, *Quick mode*, *etc.*)

* Determines the structure and purpose of the ISAKMP message
* Influences the subsequent negotiation process

## Flags

The Flags field contains various flags that provide additional information about the ISAKMP message (Ex: *Flags may indicate whether the message is encrypted*, *etc.*)

## Message ID

The Message ID field contains the unique ID of the ISAKMP message that's being exchanged

## Length

The Length field specifies the total length of the ISAKMP message, including the ISAKMP header and any payload data

* Helps the receiving party determine the boundaries of the message and properly parse its contents
