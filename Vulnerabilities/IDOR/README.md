# Insecure Direct Object Reference Overview

IDOR allows a user to access resources that don't belong to them by directly referencing the object ID, object number, or filename

* IDOR happens when an application fails to implement access control based on user identity and fails to randomize object IDs by instead keeping reference to data objects predictable
