# Referer-Based Open Redirect

* The referer is an HTTP request header that browsers automatically include (It tells the server where the request originated from)
* Referer headers are a common way of determining the user's original location since they contain the URL that linked to the current page (Meaning that some sites will redirect to the page's referer URL automatically after certain user actions)
