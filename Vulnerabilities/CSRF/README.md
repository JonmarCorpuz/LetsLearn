# Cross-Sire Request Forgery Overview

CSRF is a client-side technique used to attack other users of a web application

* Allows attackers to send HTTP requests that pretend to come from the victim in order to carry out unwanted actions on their behalf
* CSRF attacks usually target state-changing requests instead of requests that reveal sensitive information since they wouldn't be able ti read the response to the forged requests sent during an CSRF attack
