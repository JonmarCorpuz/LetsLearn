1. Create: The initial phase of the data lifecycle where the data is created and categorized, and the data owner is defined

 2. Store: The created data is processed based on its form and stored in a database

	* Data can be either:
		* Structured: Organized and well-formatted data that fits into a predefined data model
		* Unstructured: Data that isn't formatted in a specified format

3. Use: Using the stored data

4. Share: Sharing the stored data either within or outside the cloud infrastructure

5. Archive: The long-term storage of the stored data for a certain amount of time

6. Destroy: The destruction of the archived data after a certain amount of time
