# Agents Overview

Agents are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage in order to maintain control over how they accomplish tasks

* The process is more open-ended
* Have feedback loops 
* The design pattern doesn't have any fixed paths
* Has some risks (*Unpredictable paths*, *Unpredictable outputs*, *Unpredictable costs*, *etc.*)
* Requires users to monitor what goes on behind the scenes and guardrails to ensure that agents behave safely, consistently, and within your intended boundaries
