A Virtual Local Area Network is a method of logically dividing a physical network into multiple virtual networks

* Allows administrators to segment traffic within a network without requiring a physical separation of devices
* VLANs are configured on either a switch by adding a 802.1q or dot1q tag to a frame, which will designate the VLAN that the traffic originated from

	* The 802.1q tag provides a standard between vendors that'll always define the VLAN of a frame
