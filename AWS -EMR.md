Amazon Elastic MapReduce is a big data solution for petabye-scale data processing, interactive analytics, and ML that use open-source frameworks

* Requires a learning curve to operate the open-source frameworks that it uses
* Can run large-scale data processing and what-if analysis by using statistical algorithms and predictive models to uncover hidden patterns, correlations, market trends, and customer preferences
* Can extract data from various sources, process it at scale, and then make that data available for applications and users
* Can analyse events from streaming data sources in real time to create long-running, highly available, and fault-tolerant streaming data pipelines
* Can analyse data using open-source ML frameworks
* Can connect to other AWS services (Ex: *AWS SageMaker Studio for large-scale model training, analysis, and reporting*, *etc.*)
