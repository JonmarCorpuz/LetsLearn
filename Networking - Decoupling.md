Decoupling refers to the practice of designing systems and components in a way that reduces their interdependencies and tight coupling

* Allows components to operate independently, communicate asynchronously, and evolve without directly affecting each other
* Aims to minimize the dependencies between different various components within a network by having each of them communicate through well-defined interfaces and protocols rather than direct interactions or shared state
* Allows network components to interact with each other in a standardized way without needing to understand the internal workings of the other component by defining clear APIs or interfaces that abstract the implementation details of underlying components
* Allows network components to operate independently and asynchronously through asynchronous communication mechanisms (Ex: *Message passing*, *Event-drive architecture*, *etc.*)
* Helps improve system resilience by isolating failures and preventing them from propagating to other components
* Enables scalability by allowing components to be independently scaled based on demand
