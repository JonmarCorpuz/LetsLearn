CloudFormation is a service that helps users automatically model, provision, and manage AWS and third-party resources by treating infrastructure as code

* Allows users to use programming languages or a simple text file to model and provision all the resources needed for their applications across all regions and accounts in an automated and secure manner
* Provides users a common language for them to describe and provision all the infrastructure resources in their cloud environment
* Enables users to create and manage a collection of related AWS resources while provisioning and updating them in an orderly and predictable fashion
* Allows users to user either JSON or YAML files to model their infrastructure and its configurations
* Allows for flexible and dynamic infrastrucutre setup that can be adjusted according to specific requirements by allowing users to define parameters to customize their resources for each deployment
* Automatically handles the order of resource provisioning based on their dependencies
* Allows for easy rollback to a previous state in case of configuration errors
