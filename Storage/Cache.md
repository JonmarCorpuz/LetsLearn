# Cache Overview

A cache is an in-memory data store designed to provide appications with submillisecond access to data

* Offers the lowest latency for accessing data but the data only exists only as long as power is supplied to memory
* Limited in size by the amount of memory available
* Usually used with an application that can't tolerate long latencies when receiving data
* Saving the contents of the cache to persistent storage at regular intervals to enable recovery to the point in time when the contents of the cache were last saved
