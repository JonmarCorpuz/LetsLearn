Malware analysis is the process of examining and understanding malicious software to identify its behavior, functionality, and potential impact on a system or network

* Gathers insight into how the malware operates (Ex: *IoCs*, *etc.*), its methods of propagation (Ex: *New technologies*, *etc.*), and its intended objectives
* Crucial for developing effective countermeausres (Ex: *Antivirus signatures*, *Intrusion detection rules*, *Security patches*, *etc.*)

# Types of Malware Analysis

## Static Malware Analysis

* Speculates behavior from text strings found in the file
* Uses a disassembler or a decompiler to reverse-engineer a binary

## Dynamic Malware Analysis

* Uses a disassembler, decompiler, and debugger to reverse-engineer a binary
