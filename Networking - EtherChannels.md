An EtherChannel, also known as a port channel or link aggregation group (LAG), is a technology that's used to combine multiple physical Ethernet links into a single logical link

* Provides higher bandwidth and increased redundancy
* Provides load balancing across the member links by distributing traffic across multiple links

# EtherChannel Negotiation

EtherChannel negotiation refers to the process where network devices dynamically form EtherChannels by bundling multiple physical links into a single logical link

* Involves the exchange of messages between the devices to determine which ports should be included in the EtherChannel and to configure the channel settings

## Link Aggregation Control Protocol

LACP allows network devices to automatically negotiate and manage the bundling of multiple physical Ethernet links into a single logical links
