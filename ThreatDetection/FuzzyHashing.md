# Fuzzy Hashing Overview

Fuzzy hashing is a technique used to compare two pieces of data and determine how similar they are by breaking a file into chunks and create a signature for each part, for which each chunk will be compared with another file's signatures in order to calculate a similarity score between 0 (Completely different) and 100 (Identical)

* Tolerates small changes and still finds similarity
